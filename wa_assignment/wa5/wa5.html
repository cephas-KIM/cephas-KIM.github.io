**Discussion Questions:**

- **Agency:** How does your navigation give users control over 
their experience?
    - Putting Resources and Events first allows veterans to 
    quickly decide if they need to get something (resources) 
    or if they want to go someplace (events). This streamlines 
    the navigation experience.
    - I also have keyboard support and the labels are literal 
    and very simply explain what everything is.
- **Inclusion:** Who might struggle with this interface, and 
how could you improve it?
    - I used the contrast checker to make sure that there was 
    good contrast from the text and the colors of the accompanying 
    background so I do not think that color will be an issue.
    - I believe that as I add more to the homescreen, I think that 
    screen reader users will have an issue with how long it would 
    take to navigate through the screen. I plan on implementing 
    skipping over sections options.
- **Community Impact:** How might different users in your chosen 
community (varying ages, technical skills, abilities) experience 
your navigation differently?
    - I feel that people with motor skill impairments may have an 
    issue with the generous spacing that I have put in.
    - Older students could prefer more straightforward 
    wording and more big and high-contrast buttons.
- **Choices:** What design decisions did you make that prioritize 
user empowerment over developer convenience?
    - Adding the more important tabs first (events & resources)
    - Short list to lower decision fatigue

**Documentation:** Write a brief reflection connecting your 
navigation choices to your community research:

- How does your navigation design serve your community's specific 
needs?
    - My navigation design makes the events tab a single source of
    truth for all events related to the VMA.
    - The navigation design also quickly connects veterans with 
    resources that they may need.
    - Finally, it also has a “Get Help Now” for more critical issues.
- What accessibility considerations are most important for your 
target users?
    - Plain language, calm motion, high contrast, visible focus, and 
    full keyboard functionality
- What would you change based on your testing?
    - I will have to continue to work with the wording of the navigation 
    bar. I may move the help now button to someplace else to make it 
    accessible at all times without the need to search for something.
