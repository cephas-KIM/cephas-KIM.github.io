        <h3>Mission Log Trend Review</h3>
        <p>I analyzed historical operations logs to identify recurring issue categories. The goal was to support faster pre-shift briefings and clearer escalation paths. I organized records, summarized key trends, and presented a short report with practical recommendations.</p>

        <h3>Readiness Checklist Improvement</h3>
        <p>This project focused on simplifying a multi-step readiness checklist used by operations teams. I mapped each step, removed duplicate checks, and clarified decision points. The revised flow reduced confusion and made handoffs easier for new team members.</p>

        <h3>Data Science Learning Portfolio</h3>
        <p>I created a small set of beginner data science notebooks to practice cleaning, exploring, and visualizing data. Each notebook documents assumptions, basic metrics, and interpretation notes. This project reflects my transition from systems engineering into data-focused problem solving.</p>
